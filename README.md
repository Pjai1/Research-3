# Web Research and Development

This repo contains all coursework for Web R&D for Year 3 of MT at KdG and is split up into three major folders

1. New Technology
    - Will be looking into Angular 2 and making a reasonably large application to showcase its utility
    - Features included in example application
        - Modules
        - Components
        - Services
            - Observables/Rx
            - OpaqueToken
        - Directives
        - Data-Binding
        - Routing
        - Dependency Injection
        - Models (type safety)
        - (Custom) Piping
        - Templates
            - (Custom) Validation
    - Also a small comparison of Ng1 vs Ng2 included
2. Comparing Angular 2 to React
    - Syntax
    - Structure, Folders, ...
    - Code Examples (Angular code of New Technology was used)
        - Data-binding
        - Component Setup
        - State Management
        - ...
    - Difficulty
    - Performance: To run these performance tests run `npm i` in both the Performance Tests folder and the sub directory. Start the http-server by running `npm start` and don't forget to run `npm run build-prod` in the sub directories as well.
3. Proof of Concept
    - Is it possible to create an application that provides us with a 'scenic' running/cycling route by running some learning algorithms such as we know in Machine and Deep Learning
    - Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) display test with P5 library
    - Clarifai Image Recognition Pattern Algorithm test for tagging input images
